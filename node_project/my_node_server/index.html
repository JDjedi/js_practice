          <p class="show-post"><p>The international environment the U.S. will face over the next century will no doubt be challenging. Europe continues to look more and more inward while its decades long project, the European Union, faces headwinds and challenges to its integrity. A resurgent Russia poses a short-term strategic threat along its periphery, extending from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean. The Middle East is beset by weak and artificial states whose ability to cope with demographic and legitimacy challenges lay increasingly in doubt. And in East Asia, the region’s impressive economic growth is fueling rivalry between the regional powers eerily reminiscent of pre World War I Europe. </p>

<p>What happens in regions just mentioned will be of critical importance to the U.S. Indeed, the regions of Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia are the most important to the U.S.’ national interests. But before we delve into the particulars of each region it is important to understand the currents driving history, which are seldom talked about. We call these currents Mega-Trends. The U.S.’, or any state’s, ability to shape and alter these currents is limited. Mega-Trends are self propelling and drive the international environment in a broad but indirect manner. Here at The Hamiltonian we identify and recognize two such Mega-Trends driving the International Environment and were illuminated, respectively, by the work of John J. Mearsheimer’s in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics(TToGPP), and Samuel P. Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations(CoC). </p>

<p>In the TToGPP Mearsheimer posits that all states seek to become their region’s hegemon(dominant power). This drive is a structural feature of the international system. Because there is no global dominant power to keep all states in check each one is forced to fend for itself via any means necessary. This drives states to become the dominant power in its region in order to ensure its security and survival. It can do this by diplomatic, economic, or military force. The methods may also be subversive. A very poignant example of a regional hegemon is the United States and the way it is able to dominate the Western Hemisphere. Even if all of the Americas were to array against the U.S. in a military engagement they could still not defeat her: that is a regional hegemon.</p>

<p>All states strive to, but only a select few may, become a regional hegemon. Other than the U.S. only one other great power in East Asia is in a position to become a regional hegemon: China. China alone has the population, wealth, development, and if these three are managed properly, the military capacity to become the region’s dominant power. Becoming the region’s dominant power essentially entails forcing the U.S. out of the region so that it may be the only dominant power in East Asia. China may do this via diplomatic, economic, or military methods. If China were to succeed in this endeavor it would allow it a free hand to project power around the globe at will, much as how the U.S. is able to do. This is not in the U.S. interests in any rational sense. However, confronting China entails tremendous risks but so does acquiescing to its dominance of East Asia. A crucial question looms with an answer that may not be satisfying. </p>

<p>In CoC Huntington posits the 20th century’s primary source of conflict was ideological, more precisely the ideological battle between Capitalism and Communism. The fall of Communism and the communist bloc coupled with a relative decline in Western power has opened the marketplace for ideas in different cultural and religious blocs. Older cultures from the Middle East to the Far East and beyond are rediscovering their old identities and embracing them. Huntington identifies 7 civilizations with distinct cultural and religious realities. These civilizations can and do encompass several nations and states. For example, Sinic civilization spans not only China but the Koreas, Taiwan, and Vietnam well. In short, Huntington tells us that religious and cultural identities will be the primary source of conflict during the 21st century centering on inter-intra-civilizational lines .</p>

<p>Huntington’s thesis also applies to other regions throughout the globe but one region in particular stands in high relief to Huntington’s thesis: the Middle East. A resurgence of interest in Islam is one of the driving forces of events in the region and we should not assume that what comes of this resurgence will be similar to what happened in the West with the spread and adoption of democracy and individual rights. This is not to say that Islam is incompatible with the values espoused by Western civilization but what we are saying is that Islamic civilization will bend to its own reality not the West's. This will produce conflict and discord between the West and the Middle East, this goes for other distinct cultural blocs as well, for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Hence, we are left with the two Mega-Trends that are to shape the international environment for the next century; one that is concurrent with where we are at this juncture in world history, the other a structural feature of the current state centered international political system. We will expound on what has been said here later and see how the two Mega-Trends elucidated here will shape the regions of Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. From there we will assess what this means for the U.S. and where the U.S.’ interests lie in such a reality.
